        <Text>
          The DOLCKER & CLIP system for ceramic facades is a high-inertia profile system with double safety. All components are manufactured with top-quality raw materials.
          <br /><br />
          This is a mechanical clip fastening system + chemical fixing through a substructure composed of high-quality aluminum brackets in the shape of "L" with a thickness of 3 mm, which transmit stresses and are fixed to the base structure of the building (brick wall or concrete slab) by anchoring. On these brackets, vertical aluminum profiles in the shape of "T" with a thickness of 3 mm are fixed using self-tapping stainless steel screws.
          <br /><br />
          On these "T"-shaped profiles, horizontal profiles in the shape of "G" are screwed, allowing the piece to be fully supported. This is the ideal system for installing ceramics, allowing pieces to be replaced since it has a stainless steel sliding clip, achieving infinite installations. Additionally, it allows the horizontal profile to be lacquered in the color of the carpentry, allowing the customer to choose the color of the joint. At least two sliding clips are placed in the upper part of the starting piece at 1/5 of the distance from the length of the piece. In the rest of the intermediate pieces, at least 4 clips will be placed for each ceramic piece. Sika-111 or similar polyurethane adhesive and sealing points (4 per piece) will be added, allowing us to absorb the expansions of the facade in the sliding clips.
          <br /><br />
          This is undoubtedly a system with multiple facade composition options, as it is possible to break the vertical joints. These vertical joints are minimized to just 1 mm, thus enhancing the horizontal joints. The ceramic output is between 43-47 mm, depending on the thickness of the chosen ceramic.

          The DOL-TC11 system for ceramic facades with hidden clip is a safe, easy, and simple system to install. All components are manufactured with top-quality raw materials.
          <br /><br />
          This is a hidden mechanical fastening system through a substructure composed of adjustable aluminum squares (brackets) with a thickness of 3 mm and a separator function, which also transmit stresses and are fixed to the base structure of the building (brick wall or concrete slab).
